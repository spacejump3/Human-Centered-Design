Welcome to blablabla ik doe dit later wel.

## Interview with Petra

Petra is a born blind woman. Our task is to create an app specifically for her to use. She wants an app where she can more easily choose what type of clothing fits each other. Here are some take-aways from the first interview we did:

**Navigating the app**

-   The most important thing is that she needs to know where she is on the site. This means that every button, link or whatever HAS to be correctly described.
-   She uses both desktop and mobile, but prefers mobile. On desktop she uses a software called nvda and on mobile she uses the built in iPhone screenreader.
-   She wants to be able to see/hear everything that the app has to offer, so no skipping links.
-   Websites and apps CAN be fun and have for example some audio, but it's important that it doesn't confuse or distract Petra.

**Clothing**

-   Her biggest difficulty is finding colors and color combinations. She does find it important that the colors look right on her. So making sure she KNOWS which colors she's choosing is an important factor.
-   If she wants to choose a clothing piece, she wants to exactly know what it looks like. So the alt text/description should be very detailed and objective (e.g. 'this blue dress has a flower pattern' instead of 'this beautiful summerlike dress has happy flowers scattered across a vibrant blue sky').
-   She has different clothing for different occasions (she mentions she has a winter- and summer box). However, she doesn't need handholding when it comes to picking these clothing items for an occassion. If it's raining outside, she will know that she wants to pick a jacket.

**Other**

-   She doesn't want to be dependant on other people to use this app.

### What will I do with this information?

So, first impressions is that it's gonna be very difficult to create this. But, I do have some first ideas:

First things first: I don't know exactly what clothing combinations she wants. Heck, she can't even TRULY know what she wants since she can't see the clothes she's wearing. So to make it simple, for my prototype I'm gonna assume which clothing combinations she prefers. That way I can completely focus on the functionality of the app. In a perfect world I would have all the data of what she likes and what combinations she likes, so that then the app would work flawlessly. So by making assumptions on the clothing/color combinations I can atleast test if the app actually works for Petra.

Now, for the ideas. I have a couple that I can work out.

- A flow chart/filtering system. The entire app is based on combinations of colors and clothing, so there is a way to filter that out. So let's say you start with a color. Since there are general conventions of what colors are nice together, we can already filter out other colors. Pink wouldn't fit green for example. So choosing pink would exclude green and vice versa.
